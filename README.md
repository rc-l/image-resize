# image-resize
Resizing images on the fly

As part of a workflow images of several formats and filetypes serve as input. This script aims to reduce manual work in the workflow. The script resizes the images and optionally adds margins to fit to size while keeping the ratios.

## Build
Optionally you can build the script into an exe using pyinstaller.
